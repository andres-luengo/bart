    "## Conclusions and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to correlate RFI pipeline observations with Starlink satellite positions to identify potential interference sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings:\n",
    "- We analyzed observations with significant overlap in the 10.6-11.2 GHz frequency range\n",
    "- For each observation, we calculated satellite positions and identified those within 1° of the beam center\n",
    "- The analysis provides satellite names, angular separations, and detailed position information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Improvements:\n",
    "1. **Time Resolution**: Consider the full observation duration, not just the start time\n",
    "2. **Beam Pattern**: Account for the actual telescope beam shape and sensitivity pattern\n",
    "3. **Satellite Movement**: Track satellite motion during the observation period\n",
    "4. **Historical TLEs**: Use TLE data that matches the observation epoch for better accuracy\n",
    "5. **Other Satellite Constellations**: Extend analysis to include OneWeb, Amazon Kuiper, etc.\n",
    "6. **Correlation with RFI Detections**: Compare satellite positions with actual RFI hit locations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Products:\n",
    "- `satellite_crossings`: Complete analysis results for each file\n",
    "- `summary_df`: DataFrame with key metrics for each observation\n",
    "- `satellite_crossing_results.csv`: Saved summary for future analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework can be extended to process larger datasets and provide systematic satellite interference monitoring for radio astronomy observations."
