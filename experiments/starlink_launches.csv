Falcon 9 successfully carried 21 of these satellites into orbit later that evening. SpaceX committed to reduce debris by keeping the Starlink tension rods, which hold the V2 mini satellites together, attached to the Falcon 9 second stage. These tension rods were discarded into orbit while launching earlier version of Starlink satellites.Observations confirm these V2 mini satellites host two solar panels like the Starship V2 satellites.",2023-02-27
